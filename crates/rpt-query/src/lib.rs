//! # rpt-query — SQL generation for the live-DB path
//!
//! The native engine builds a join graph from a report's decoded link metadata and emits joined
//! SQL to the query engine — a multi-table report needs every
//! referenced table joined into one query, not just the primary table. This crate is the
//! SQL-generation layer that produces that joined SQL: given a report's [`Database`] (tables +
//! links) it produces a single `SELECT … FROM … JOIN …` and the ordered [`QueryColumn`] list a
//! fetcher uses to key and re-type each returned column. It is pure (no I/O) and WASM-safe — the
//! structured SQL is rendered by [`sea_query`] (core only, no driver/binder features) so quoting,
//! text-casts, and joins are dialect-correct; the DB driver (native-only) consumes the string it
//! returns.
//!
//! Dialects: Postgres / SQLite / MySQL, via sea-query's per-dialect builders. Author-written
//! command tables (Crystal SQL Commands) are passed through **verbatim** and cannot be expressed as
//! a structured sea-query source, so a report containing one is rendered by the hand-rolled string
//! path instead; fully-structured reports use sea-query.
//!
//! Scope: `INNER`/`LEFT`/`RIGHT` joins over the link graph, multi-field link conditions, self-joins
//! (each table is aliased), command tables (`FROM (<sql>) AS alias`), and — via
//! [`build_query_full`] — pushing the translatable subset of the record-selection formula
//! into `WHERE`. A link's outer-ness and its comparison operator are stored separately, so any
//! combination renders (a left outer `>=` join is expressible); a full outer join has no
//! sea-query/keyword counterpart here and degrades to an inner join.
