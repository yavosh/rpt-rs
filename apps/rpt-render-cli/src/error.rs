//! The CLI's typed render error, and how a failure reaches stderr — the cause-chain reporter and
//! the crash/backtrace panic hook.
//!
//! This lives in the CLI rather than the `rpt-render` library because the library's render path is
//! infallible — every failure a render can hit (datasource resolution, parameter coercion, a DB
//! driver, output I/O) is raised here, by the CLI. Each variant that wraps a real underlying error
//! keeps it as the [`source`](std::error::Error::source), so the top-level reporter can print the
//! whole cause chain instead of a flattened string.
