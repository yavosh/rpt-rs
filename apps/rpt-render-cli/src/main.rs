//! `rpt-render` — the unified command-line renderer for Crystal Reports (`.rpt`).
//!
//! One entrypoint for the five inputs a render needs — the report, a datasource (embedded saved data
//! or a live database via `--db`), a locale, report parameters, and an output destination (file or
//! stdout) — with NORMAL/VERBOSE logging and a pre-fetch DB healthcheck.
//! Companion to the `rpt` inspection/export CLI.
//!
//! This module doc is the authoritative usage contract; the [`USAGE`] string mirrors it for `--help`,
//! and the per-module docs ([`datasource`], [`params`], [`locale`]) document the internals.
//!
//! ## Invocation
//! ```text
//! rpt-render <file.rpt> [OPTIONS]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Flags
//! - `--saved` / `--db` (mutually exclusive) — datasource selection; default (neither) is the
//!   report's saved data if present, else empty (only static bands render).
//! - `--list-fonts` — print the font library a render would use (face count, origins, searched
//!   directories, generic mappings) and exit; needs no report. `-v` lists every face with its path.
//! - `--list-sources` — print the report's live data sources and the exact env var to set for each,
//!   then exit without rendering.
//! - `-p`, `--param Name=Value` — a report parameter; repeatable, and repeating one name builds a
//!   multi-value parameter. Values are coerced to the declared type (see [`params`]).
//! - `--locale <tag>` — locale for date/number formatting (e.g. `en-US`, `de-DE`).
//! - `--system-fonts` — measure and embed the host's installed faces instead of the bundled ones (see
//!   [Fonts](#fonts)).
//! - `--pdfa <1b|2b|3b|1a|2a|3a>` — export against a PDF/A archival standard (see
//!   [Archival](#archival-pdfa)); the `a` levels additionally require tagging.
//! - `--pdfua` — export against PDF/UA-1, the accessibility standard (see [Tagging](#tagging)).
//! - `--tagged` — emit a structure tree without claiming any standard.
//! - `--lang <tag>` — the document's natural language (`en-US`); no report stores one.
//! - `--title <text>` — the document's title, overriding the report's own summary title.
//! - `--alt <Object>=<text>` — alternate text for a picture or chart; repeatable, and an empty text
//!   marks the graphic decorative.
//! - `-o`, `--output <path>` — output file (`-` or omitted = stdout).
//! - `-v`/`--verbose`, `-q`/`--quiet` (mutually exclusive), `-h`/`--help`, `-V`/`--version`.
//!
//! ## Datasource (`--db`) URL schemes
//! `--db` takes the connection URL(s) from the environment (never the command line, so no password
//! leaks into `ps`/history). The URL scheme selects the backend:
//!
//! - `postgres://` (or `postgresql://`) — implemented.
//! - `sqlite:///path/to/file.db` (or `sqlite::memory:`) — implemented.
//! - `mysql://`, `mariadb://`, `mssql://`/`sqlserver://` — recognized but not yet implemented.
//!
//! A single-server report reads `RPT_DB_URL`, falling back to `DATABASE_URL`. A report that spans
//! multiple servers (via subreports) needs one URL per distinct server in `RPT_DB_URL_<SERVER>`,
//! where `<SERVER>` is the server name upper-cased with non-alphanumerics turned to `_`. Run
//! `--list-sources` to print the exact variable names for a report. (See [`datasource`].)
//!
//! ## Locale resolution
//! Precedence: an explicit `--locale` overrides the host OS locale (`LC_ALL`/`LC_NUMERIC`/`LANG`),
//! which overrides the `en-US` fallback. (See [`locale`].)
//!
//! ## Fonts
//! By default both halves of the font stack — the metrics layout measures with and the faces the PDF
//! embeds — come from the **bundled** Liberation/DejaVu set, so the same report and rows render to the
//! same bytes on every machine. `--system-fonts` switches both halves to the host's installed library,
//! which is what you want when the report's real faces are installed and fidelity matters more than
//! reproducibility. Only Arial, Times New Roman and Courier New are metric-compatible with the bundled
//! set, so for any other family the two modes lay text out differently.
//!
//! ## Archival (PDF/A)
//! `--pdfa 1b|2b|3b` exports against the corresponding ISO 19005 level-B standard. It is a **checked
//! claim**: the render fails, naming every unmet requirement, rather than writing a file that claims
//! conformance it does not honour — so a `--pdfa` run either produces a conforming document or produces
//! nothing and exits non-zero. `--pdfa 1a|2a|3a` adds the level-A accessibility requirements, which is
//! the same claim plus the tagging one below.
//!
//! The levels are not "newer is better". `1b` is PDF 1.4 and forbids transparency and 16-bit images
//! outright, so a report that legally uses either fails `--pdfa 1b` and passes `--pdfa 2b` — that is
//! the standards differing, not a defect. Conforming output also differs from ordinary output by
//! design: rasters embed uninterpolated (PDF/A forbids `/Interpolate true`), and the document carries
//! an output intent, XMP metadata and a creation date. The date is the Unix epoch, not the host clock,
//! so the same report still renders to the same bytes on every machine and every run.
//!
//! ## Tagging
//! `--tagged` adds a **structure tree** — what each mark means and in what order it is read — and
//! claims nothing. `--pdfua` (ISO 14289-1) and `--pdfa 1a|2a|3a` are the standards that require one,
//! and they are checked claims like the archival levels.
//!
//! A conforming tree needs three things a `.rpt` does not fully carry, so the render is **refused**,
//! naming each, rather than granting an accessibility claim it cannot support:
//!
//! - the document's **natural language** (`--lang en-US`) — no report stores one, and the render
//!   locale states number and date conventions rather than language;
//! - a **title** (PDF/UA-1 only) — taken from the report's summary information when the author filled
//!   it in, overridable with `--title`;
//! - **alternate text** for every picture and chart (`--alt <Object>=<text>`) — taken from the
//!   object's stored `ToolTipText` when it has one. `--alt <Object>=` with an empty text is the HTML
//!   `alt=""` convention: the graphic is decorative and is emitted as an artifact. The refusal names
//!   each undescribed figure, so a first run tells you exactly which `--alt` flags to add.
//!
//! ## Output
//! PDF is the only output format, so there is nothing to select and no `--format` flag: `-o` names a
//! path, `-` or omitting it writes to stdout. The document is a single self-contained file, safe to
//! pipe, and always overwrites. A path ending `.html`, `.svg` or `.png` is refused — those formats
//! existed in 0.3.0, so such a command was written against the old CLI and its extension says what the
//! caller expected.

// `db` is an umbrella over the driver-agnostic live-DB machinery, turned on BY each driver feature
// and never selectable alone: without a driver every `--db` render resolves its connections and then
// fails with "not available in this build", so the whole path is reachable only through a driver.
// Rejecting the combination at compile time is what lets the code gate that machinery on plain
// `feature = "db"` — under any buildable configuration it implies at least one driver.
#[cfg(all(
    feature = "db",
    not(any(feature = "db-postgres", feature = "db-sqlite"))
))]

    " — render a Crystal Reports (.rpt) file to PDF

Opens the report, runs the data pipeline + layout engine, and writes the paginated result through
the chosen backend. Rows come from the report's embedded saved data (default) or a live database
(--db); text is laid out and embedded from the bundled faces, so the output is the same on every
machine (--system-fonts uses the host's installed faces instead).

USAGE:
    rpt-render <file.rpt> [OPTIONS]

ARGS:
    <file.rpt>              the report to render

DATASOURCE (default: the report's saved data if present, else empty):
        --saved            use the report's embedded saved data
        --db               fetch rows live (main report + subreports) from the database URL(s) in
                           the environment (see DATABASE CONFIGURATION). The URL scheme selects the
                           backend.
        --list-sources     print the report's live data sources and the exact env var to set for
                           each, then exit (no render). Use this to discover what `--db` needs.
        --list-fonts       print the font library a render would use — how many faces, where they
                           came from, which directories were searched, and what the sans-serif /
                           serif / monospace generics resolve to — then exit. Needs no <file.rpt>.
                           Add -v for a line per face with its path; add --system-fonts to list the
                           host's library instead of the bundled one.

PARAMETERS:
    -p, --param Name=Value report parameter (see `rpt inputs <file>`). Repeatable; repeat the same
                           name for a multi-value parameter. Values are coerced to the declared type.

LOCALE:
        --locale <tag>     locale for date/number formatting (e.g. en-US, de-DE). Default: the host
                           locale (LC_ALL/LC_NUMERIC/LANG), else en-US.
        --datetime-to-date render DateTime database fields as dates (the report option 'convert
                           date-time field: to Date' of legacy CR8-upgraded reports, which the
                           reader does not yet decode from the file).

FONTS (default: the bundled Liberation/DejaVu faces, so the render is reproducible on any machine):
        --system-fonts     lay out and embed the host's installed faces instead. Use it when the
                           report's real fonts are installed and fidelity matters more than
                           reproducibility; the output then depends on this machine's font library.

ARCHIVAL (default: an ordinary PDF with no conformance claim):
        --pdfa <LEVEL>     export against the PDF/A standard of that part+level (ISO 19005-1/-2/-3).
                           The claim is CHECKED: if the document does not meet the level the render
                           fails, listing every unmet requirement, and writes nothing — a file
                           claiming conformance it does not honour is worse than no file.

                           The levels differ in what they FORBID, so newer is not simply better:
                             1b   PDF 1.4 — no transparency, no 16-bit images. Most portable, most
                                  restrictive; a report using either legitimately will fail here.
                             2b   PDF 1.7 — transparency and JPEG2000 allowed. The usual choice.
                             3b   as 2b, plus arbitrary file attachments (which this renderer never
                                  emits); pick it only if your archive mandates the -3 family.
                             1a / 2a / 3a
                                  the same, plus the level-A accessibility requirements — a tagged
                                  structure tree and the semantics under ACCESSIBILITY below.

                           So `--pdfa 1b` failing on a report that `--pdfa 2b` renders is the standards
                           differing, not a bug.

                           Conforming output differs from ordinary output by design — rasters embed
                           uninterpolated (PDF/A forbids interpolation), and the file carries an output
                           intent, XMP metadata and a creation date. That date is the Unix epoch rather
                           than the host clock, so the render stays byte-reproducible.

ACCESSIBILITY (default: no structure tree):
        --tagged           emit a structure tree — what each mark means and in what order it is read —
                           without claiming any standard. Makes the report readable by assistive
                           technology and copy-pasteable in reading order.
        --pdfua            export against PDF/UA-1 (ISO 14289-1), the accessibility standard. A
                           CHECKED claim, like --pdfa, and it implies --tagged.

                           A conforming tree needs three things the .rpt does not fully carry, so the
                           render is REFUSED — naming each — rather than claiming an accessibility it
                           cannot deliver:
        --lang <tag>       the document's natural language, e.g. en-US. REQUIRED by --pdfua and
                           --pdfa 1a|2a|3a: no report stores one, and --locale states number/date
                           conventions rather than language, so it cannot stand in.
        --title <text>     the document's title. PDF/UA-1 requires one and makes the viewer show it.
                           Defaults to the report's own summary title when the author filled it in
                           (many leave it empty); this flag overrides it.
        --alt <Obj>=<text> alternate text describing the picture or chart named <Obj>. Repeatable.
                           Defaults to the object's stored ToolTipText when it has one. An EMPTY text
                           (--alt Picture1=) is the HTML alt=\"\" convention: the graphic carries no
                           information and is emitted as an artifact instead of a figure.
                           The refusal names every undescribed figure, so one failed run tells you
                           exactly which flags to add.

OUTPUT:
    -o, --output <path>    output file; '-' or omitted writes to stdout. PDF is the only output
                           format, so there is no --format flag. The PDF is one self-contained file,
                           safe to pipe, and always overwrites. A .html/.svg/.png path is refused:
                           those formats were removed in 0.4.0.

LOGGING:
    -v, --verbose          verbose: also log the SQL sent, timings, and push-down decisions
    -q, --quiet            quiet: errors only
    -h, --help             show this help and exit
    -V, --version          show the version and exit

EXAMPLES:
    # Render the report's saved data to a PDF
    rpt-render report.rpt -o out.pdf

    # Pass parameters (repeat a name for a multi-value parameter); pipe the PDF to stdout
    rpt-render report.rpt -p AsOfDate=2026-01-31 -p Region=West -p Region=East > out.pdf

    # Render from a live database with -v to see the SQL sent and timings
    RPT_DB_URL='postgres://rpt:secret@db.internal:5432/sales' \\
        rpt-render report.rpt --db -o out.pdf -v

    # Use the host's installed faces (this machine's Arial, Calibri, …) instead of the bundled ones
    rpt-render report.rpt --system-fonts -o out.pdf

    # Export an archival PDF/A-2b; a document that does not meet the level fails instead of writing
    rpt-render report.rpt --pdfa 2b -o archive.pdf

    # Export an accessible PDF/UA-1; the language is not in the report, so it has to be stated
    rpt-render report.rpt --pdfua --lang en-US -o accessible.pdf

    # ...and a report with a chart needs that chart described (an empty text = decorative)
    rpt-render report.rpt --pdfua --lang en-US --alt 'Chart1=Sales by region, 2019-2024' -o out.pdf

DATABASE CONFIGURATION (--db):
    The connection is a single URL taken from the environment — RPT_DB_URL (or DATABASE_URL). It is
    read from the environment, never the command line, so the password is not visible in `ps` or
    shell history; securing the environment itself is up to you. The URL SCHEME selects the backend:

        postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname     (or postgresql://)   [implemented]
        mysql://user:password@host:port/dbname                             [not yet]
        mariadb://user:password@host:port/dbname                           [not yet]
        sqlite:///path/to/file.db  (or sqlite::memory:)                    [implemented]
        mssql://user:password@host:port/dbname        (or sqlserver://)    [not yet]

    Examples (RPT_DB_URL takes precedence; DATABASE_URL is the fallback — use either):

        # inline for one run
        RPT_DB_URL='postgres://rpt:secret@db.internal:5432/sales' \\
            rpt-render report.rpt --db -o out.pdf

        # exported once (e.g. the 12-factor DATABASE_URL), reused across commands
        export DATABASE_URL='postgres://rpt:secret@db.internal:5432/sales'
        rpt-render report.rpt --db -o out.pdf

    postgres and sqlite are implemented; mysql, mariadb, and mssql are recognized (the scheme is
    understood) but not yet implemented.

    MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS:
        A report (with its subreports) can read from more than one server. Each distinct SERVER gets
        its own variable, RPT_DB_URL_<SERVER>, where <SERVER> is the server name upper-cased with
        non-alphanumerics turned to '_'. Run `--list-sources` to print the exact names for a report:

            $ rpt-render report.rpt --list-sources
            report.rpt: reads from 2 data source(s). Set a connection URL for each:
              sales-db/sales [ODBC (RDO)] (12 tables)
                export RPT_DB_URL_SALES_DB='postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname'
              hr-db/hr [ODBC (RDO)] (3 tables)
                export RPT_DB_URL_HR_DB='postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname'

        A single-server report also accepts the generic RPT_DB_URL / DATABASE_URL shown above.

    SECURITY:
        The connection URL — including any password — is read ONLY from the environment, never from
        a command-line flag, so it does not appear in `ps` output or shell history. rpt-render also
        redacts the password from all of its own log lines. Beyond that, protecting the environment
        is your responsibility: prefer a secrets manager or a root-owned env file over a plaintext
        `export` in a shared shell, and avoid printing the environment in CI logs.
